# DevCycle OpenFeature JavaScript Web Example App

An example app built using the [DevCycle OpenFeature Web Provider](https://docs.devcycle.com/sdk/client-side-sdks/javascript/javascript-openfeature)

## Creating a Demo Feature
This example app requires that your project has a feature with the expected variables, as well as some simple targeting rules. 

#### ⇨ [Click here](https://app.devcycle.com/r/create?resource=feature&key=hello-togglebot) to automatically create the feature in your project ⇦

When you run the example app and switch your identity between users, you'll be able to see the feature's different variations.

## Running the Example
### Setup

* Run `npm install` in the project directory to install dependencies
* Create a `.env` file and set `DEVCYCLE_CLIENT_SDK_KEY` to the SDK Key for your environment.\
You can find this under [Settings > Environments](https://app.devcycle.com/r/environments) on the DevCycle dashboard.

### Development

`npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

To experiment with targeting, update the user objects in `src/users.js` based on your targeting rules.

### Testing

`npm run test`

See `src/devcycle.test.js` for examples of mocking the DevCycle SDK.
